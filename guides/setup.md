# Setup

## Add the bot
First, if you haven't already, add the bot to your server. 
Please ensure it has all the permissions as it needs this to function correctly. <br>
<a href="https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1049461268102270997&scope=bot%20applications.commands&permissions=805436448">Add to server</a>

## Setup
Type /setup in tyour staff only channel to create level roles & get the bot active and ready to start leveling people up.

## Done!
You shouldn't have to do anymore after this point, just let your members level up and perhaps add rewards for level roles (image perms, special chat, shoutout, etc)
