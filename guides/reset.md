# Resetting the bot

## Slight reset
If you run the command /reset, then the bot will delete all level roles & XP of the members of your server. They can continue to gain XP afterwards.

## Full reset
If you wish to completely get rid of the bot, please remove it from your server. If you encounter any extreme bugs, you can do this and still keep your XP.

## Complete removal
If you have any issues removing the bot from your server please join the support server and I will assist you as soon as possible.
